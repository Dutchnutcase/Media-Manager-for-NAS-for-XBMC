Why this tool?
- changing database informations on the NAS with no need to have XBMC or clients on (from work, school, vacation ...)
- Learning the CodeIgniter framework and some tips with JQuery.

The requirements are the followings:
- clients can be turn on windows or linux system
- the server MUST turn on a linux system ONLY
- you need a php server like apache on your server
- XBMC is yet using a mysql database and a folder to centralise Thumbails images
- Check the user of your mysql server can create database
- the sources can be samba share folders but i have made only tests with mounted file system by nfs.
- I assume you use a folder on the server to centralise the thumbnails.

How to install the application:
- download the archive and uncompress it in a folder on the server (typically '/var/ww').
- browse to http://SERVER_IP and follow the four step of the wizard.
- connect to http://SERVER_IP and login (username and password are xbmc) and configure the sources in the administration part of the applicaton to indicate the correspondence between client paths and server paths.
- add a new user account with the credentials you want.

Note: the wizard make a symbolic link to the thumbails folder to access directly the images accross the application.

How to use the application:
- No need to use the application and XBMC at the same time!
- if not logged in, you only can browse between the media (movies, sets, tvshows, actors/actress)
- the application makes his own thumbails in poor quality for the navigation.
- if logged in and can change images, the first time you consult a media page (movie, set or tvshow), the application download ALL the images to choose one, [B]be patient![/B]. You can upload images too.
- if logged in and can infos, you can modify movie order in set, add/delete sets, change tagline and overview.
- download button are not implemented yet
- you can refresh data only for movies for the moment.
- home and dashboard are unfinished for the moment.

I don't manage the music for the moment, sorry.

I hope this long post is correctly written and the application useful, there is a lot of work to perform the application.
